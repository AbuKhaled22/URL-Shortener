# URL Shortener Microservice

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML-based URL Shortener Microservice. Its purpose is to shorten long URLs into more concise ones. Users can submit a URL through a form, and the microservice will generate a shortened version.

## Features

- **URL Shortening:** Users can input a URL in the provided form and receive a shortened URL as output.
- **Example:** An example URL (`https://www.freecodecamp.org/`) is provided to guide users on how to input their URLs.
- **Access Shortened URLs:** Users can access the shortened URL by appending it to the microservice's endpoint (`/api/shorturl/:shorturl`), where `:shorturl` should be replaced with the actual shortened code.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Input a URL in the form field and click "POST URL."
3. Receive a shortened URL.
4. To access the original URL, use the shortened URL by appending it to the microservice's endpoint (`/api/shorturl/:shorturl`).

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the microservice.
- **style.css:** The stylesheet for styling the HTML elements.
- **index.js:**  the back end for website
